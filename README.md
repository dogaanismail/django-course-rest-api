Project Description
An API (application programming interface) allows different programs to communicate/interact with one another. REST is a set of rules that describe how the client and server will communicate with each other.

Django REST is one of the most effective and flexible tools to build Web APIs. Django REST provides usability, makes authentication easy, and serializes complex data.

In this project, we’ll start with a default Django application, create a model, and add it to the database using migrations. After that, we’ll create a serializer to convert complex objects into native Python objects. Essentially, we’ll create a complete API for our model that will read, create, update, and delete a record from the database.
